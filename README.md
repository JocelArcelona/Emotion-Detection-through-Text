# Objectives 
This text based emotion detection project aims to clean, parse and analyze textual data from twitter to predict user emotions using Natural Language Processing. Another objective of this project is to use different classification models to figure out which one produces the best metric score. Picking the best classification model will provide us with the least emotion misclassification. This dataset contains tweet ids, tweets and the sentiment for each tweets. After extractintg the dataset from Kaggle, I had to parse through the texts to figure out how to clean it for further preprocessing.
